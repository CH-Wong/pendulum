# Pendulum Simulator
This package contains some Runga-Kutta implementations of some common physics problems. Most interestingly, there is an implementation of a pendulum in 2D and 3D, as well as an implementation of the three-body problem. 

This package was mostly created out of an interest in exploring Runga-Kutta integration methods, as well as wanting to have some tangential experience with non-linear dynamics of chaotic systems. 


To run the examples in this package, you need to run them as python modules. For example, to run the 3D pendulum simulation package you can try:

```
python -m examples.3d_pendulum_animation
```
